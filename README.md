# Road-Safety-Translator
Overview
With India's unique linguistic terrain, ensuring road safety
messages and government regulations reach every population in
their local language is a significant challenge. Current practices
have shortcomings unable to have effective reach to every road
user.
Solution
I have developed an AI-powered multilingual platform that
ensures accurate and precise translations of road safety-related
government orders, policies, guidelines, and awareness content.
The platform must account for regional dialects, cultural context,
and technical terms related to road safety, ensuring that the
essence of each message is preserved across multiple languages.
